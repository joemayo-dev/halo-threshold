Husky Raid style map, themed as Threshold gas mine.

## Notes
[Threshold gas mine](https://www.halopedia.org/Threshold_gas_mine)

This gas mine was a large [Forerunner](https://www.halopedia.org/Forerunner) structure suspended in the atmosphere of the gas giant [Threshold](https://www.halopedia.org/Threshold), the planet around which [Installation 04](https://www.halopedia.org/Installation_04) orbited. It was an expansive automated facility that was created and used by the Forerunners and later, by [Sesa 'Refumee's heretic faction](https://www.halopedia.org/Sesa_%27Refumee%27s_heretic_faction). It was destroyed when it fell into Threshold and was crushed by the planet's gravity.[[2]](https://www.halopedia.org/Threshold_gas_mine#cite_note-oracle-2) It was one of many similar facilities on Threshold.[[4]](https://www.halopedia.org/Threshold_gas_mine#cite_note-art-4)

The station was divided into five modules: two gas refinement arms, each with its own cargo hangar, two laboratory modules for the research of the Flood, and the final module was the control section of the mine. Each of these modules could be accessed by catwalks or landing sites.
